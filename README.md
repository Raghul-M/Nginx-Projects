This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects to understand and explore the core functionalities of **NGINX**. Each project is designed to help you build practical knowledge by setting up and experimenting with real-world scenarios.


### üìò What‚Äôs Inside

This repo covers the following key NGINX use-cases:

- **Static Website Hosting**  
  Learn how to use NGINX to serve HTML and static assets.

- **Reverse Proxy**  
  Route incoming requests to backend services like Streamlit apps using NGINX.

- **Load Balancer**  
  Distribute traffic across multiple backend services using NGINX as a load balancer.

### üéØ Goal

To provide a simple, project-based learning path for mastering the essentials of NGINX as:

- A **web server**
- A **reverse proxy**
- A **load balancer**

Each project is built and tested on an **Ubuntu EC2 instance** for real deployment experience.
